## Introduction to Computer Networks
A computer network is a set of interconnected devices capable of exchanging data and sharing resources. These devices can include computers, servers, routers, switches, printers, and more. This guide will explore computer networks in detail, covering fundamental concepts to advanced topics.

### Why Networks Matter
Networks facilitate:
- **Communication**: Enabling instant messaging, email, and video conferencing.
- **Resource Sharing**: Allowing multiple users to access printers, files, and internet connections.
- **Data Centralization**: Storing and managing data in a central location for easier access and backup.
- **Cost Reduction**: Sharing hardware and software resources, reducing overall expenses.
- **Entertainment**: Streaming video and audio content.
  
## Network Fundamentals 
### Network Topologies
A network topology defines the physical or logical arrangement of network devices. Common topologies include:
- **Bus Topology**: All devices connect to a single cable. Simple to implement but susceptible to failures.
- **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub or switch. More robust than bus topology.
- **Ring Topology**: Devices connect in a closed loop. Data travels in one direction.
- **Mesh Topology**: Each device connects to multiple other devices. Provides redundancy and high reliability.
- **Tree Topology**: A hierarchical structure combining star and bus topologies.
### Network Types
- **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: A network covering a small area, such as a home or office. Examples include Bluetooth connections between devices.
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network connecting devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, school, or office building.
- **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A network covering a larger area than a LAN, such as a city or town.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network covering a large geographical area, such as a country or the world. The internet is the largest WAN.
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: Extends a private network across a public network, enabling users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to the private network.
### Network Devices
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: Allows a device to connect to a network.
- **Hub**: A simple device that forwards data to all connected devices.
- **Switch**: A more intelligent device that forwards data only to the intended recipient.
- **Router**: Connects different networks and routes data between them.
- **Firewall**: A security device that protects a network from unauthorized access.
- **Modem**: Modulates and demodulates signals for transmitting data over telephone lines or other media.
  
## The OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
### The OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers:
1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and electrical signals.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Manages node-to-node delivery of data frames and error detection/correction.
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Handles routing of data packets between different networks.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Ensures reliable data transfer between end systems.
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Handles data encryption, compression, and translation.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Provides network services directly to end-users.
   
### The TCP/IP Model
The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a more practical model used in real-world networking. It consists of four layers:
1. **Network Interface Layer**: Corresponds to the Physical and Data Link layers of the OSI model.
2. **Internet Layer**: Corresponds to the Network layer of the OSI model.
3. **Transport Layer**: Corresponds to the Transport layer of the OSI model.
4. **Application Layer**: Combines the Session, Presentation, and Application layers of the OSI model.
   
### Comparison
| Feature | OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Layers | 7 | 4 |
| Development | Developed before protocols were implemented | Developed after protocols were implemented |
| Practicality | Theoretical | Practical |
| Focus | Comprehensive | Implementation-oriented |

## Networking Protocols
### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
- Uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.
- Uses sequence numbers to ensure data is delivered in the correct order.
- Includes error detection and retransmission mechanisms.
### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Provides a connectionless and unreliable delivery of data.
- Faster than TCP because it does not establish a connection or guarantee delivery.
- Suitable for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as streaming video.
### IP (Internet Protocol)
- Provides addressing and routing functions for data packets.
- Uses IP addresses to identify devices on a network.
- Routes packets from source to destination across multiple networks.
### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Used for transferring files, such as web pages, over the internet.
- Uses requests and responses to communicate between clients and servers.
- Common methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
- A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data.
- Provides confidentiality and integrity for data transmitted over the internet.
### DNS (Domain Name System) {#dns-(domain-name-system)}
- Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
- Uses a hierarchical system of DNS servers.
- Essential for accessing websites and other online services.
### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) {#dhcp-(dynamic-host-configuration-protocol)}
- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- Simplifies network administration by eliminating the need to manually configure IP addresses.
### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- Used for sending email messages.
- Transfers email from a client to a mail server.
  
### POP3/IMAP (Post Office Protocol version 3/Internet Message Access Protocol)
- Used for retrieving email messages from a mail server.
- POP3 downloads email to the client device, while IMAP allows email to be accessed from multiple devices.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting
### IP Addresses
An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
- **IPv4**: Uses 32-bit addresses, represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **IPv6**: Uses 128-bit addresses, represented in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
### IP Address Classes
IPv4 addresses are divided into classes:
- **Class A**: 1-126. Supports a large number of hosts.
- **Class B**: 128-191. Supports a medium number of hosts.
- **Class C**: 192-223. Supports a small number of hosts.
- **Class D**: 224-239. Used for multicast addressing.
- **Class E**: 240-254. Reserved for experimental purposes.
### Private IP Addresses
These IP addresses are used for internal networks and are not routable on the internet:
- **Class A**: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
- **Class B**: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
- **Class C**: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
### Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks. This improves network performance and security.
- **Subnet Mask**: Used to identify the network and host portions of an IP address.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet traffic. It uses a suffix that indicates the number of bits in the network prefix. Example: 192.168.1.0/24 indicates the first 24 bits are the network address, and the remaining 8 bits are for host addresses.
#### Subnetting Example
Suppose you have a Class C network, 192.168.1.0, and you want to create two subnets.
1. **Determine the number of bits to borrow**: To create two subnets, you need to borrow 1 bit from the host portion.
2. **New Subnet Mask**: The default subnet mask for Class C is 255.255.255.0. By borrowing 1 bit, the new subnet mask becomes 255.255.255.128. (/25)
3. **Subnet Ranges**:
- Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127
- Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.255
4. **Usable Host Ranges**:
- Subnet 1: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.126 (192.168.1.0 is the network address, and 192.168.1.127 is the broadcast address)
- Subnet 2: 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.254 (192.168.1.128 is the network address, and 192.168.1.255 is the broadcast address)
  
## Routing
Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination.
### Routing Protocols
- **Distance Vector Routing**: Routers share their routing tables with their neighbors. Examples include RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
- **Link State Routing**: Routers maintain a map of the entire network topology. Examples include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
- **Path Vector Routing**: Routers share information about the paths to different networks. Examples include BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
### Static vs. Dynamic Routing
- **Static Routing**: Routes are manually configured by the administrator. Suitable for small networks.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Routes are automatically learned and updated by routing protocols. Suitable for large and complex networks.
### Routing Table
A routing table is a data table stored in a router or other networked device that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes. The routing table contains information about:
- **Destination Network**: The network address of the destination.
- **Next Hop**: The IP address of the next router to forward the packet to.
- **Interface**: The interface on the router to use to forward the packet.
- **Metric**: A value that indicates the "cost" of using a particular route.
  
## Network Security
### Common Threats
- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware.
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails or websites designed to steal personal information.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks**: Overwhelming a network or server with traffic to make it unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between two parties.
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in database applications.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into websites.
### Security Measures
- **Firewalls**: Control network traffic and block unauthorized access.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and take action to prevent attacks.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Create secure connections over public networks.
- **Encryption**: Protect data by converting it into an unreadable format. Examples: SSL/TLS for web traffic, IPsec for VPNs.
- **Authentication**: Verify the identity of users and devices. Examples: Passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Control which users or devices have access to specific resources.
- **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the network.
- **Security Awareness Training**: Educate users about security threats and best practices.
### Wireless Security Protocols
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: An older and less secure protocol. Avoid using it.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: An improved security protocol that uses TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)**: A more secure protocol that uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)**: The latest and most secure protocol. Uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly handshake.
