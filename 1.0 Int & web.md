## HTML: Structuring the Web {#html-structuring-the-web}
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all web pages. It provides the structure and content that users see in their browsers.
### Core Concepts {#core-concepts}
- **Tags**: HTML uses tags, enclosed in angle brackets (< >), to define elements. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (<p>) and a closing tag (</p>).
- **Elements**: An element is a combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (e.g., <p>This is a paragraph.</p>).
- **Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag (e.g., <a href="https://www.example.com">).
- **Document Structure**: A basic HTML document has the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- **`<html>`**: The root element of the HTML page.
- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, and links to CSS and JavaScript files. This information is *not* displayed on the page itself.
- **`<title>`**: Specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or tab).
- **`<body>`**: Contains the visible page content.
### Common HTML Elements {#common-html-elements}
- **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` represent different levels of headings. `<h1>` is the most important, and `<h6>` is the least.
- **Paragraphs**: `<p>` defines a paragraph of text.
- **Links**: `<a>` creates a hyperlink to another web page or resource. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the link.
- **Images**: `<img>` embeds an image in the page. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text if the image cannot be displayed.
- **Lists**:
- `<ul>`: Unordered list (bulleted list).
- `<ol>`: Ordered list (numbered list).
- `<li>`: List item (within `<ul>` or `<ol>`).
- **Divs and Spans**:
- `<div>`: Defines a division or section in an HTML document. It's a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
- `<span>`: Defines a section in a line (inline) of an HTML document. It's an inline element and only takes up as much width as necessary.
- **Forms**: Used to collect user input.
- `<form>`: Defines an HTML form for user input.
- `<input>`: Defines an input field, such as text, password, or submit button. The `type` attribute specifies the type of input.
- `<textarea>`: Defines a multi-line text input area.
- `<button>`: Defines a clickable button.
- `<select>`: Defines a dropdown list.
- `<label>`: Defines a label for an input element.
- **Tables**:
- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
- `<th>`: Defines a table header cell.
- `<td>`: Defines a table data cell.
### Semantic HTML {#semantic-html}
Semantic HTML uses tags that describe the meaning of the content, not just how it should look. This improves accessibility and SEO. Examples include:
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site.
- `<aside>`: Represents a section of a page that is tangentially related to the content around it (e.g., a sidebar).
- `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.
- `<header>`: Represents introductory content, typically at the beginning of a section or page.
- `<footer>`: Represents the footer of a section or page.
- `<main>`: Specifies the main content of a document.
## CSS: Styling the Web {#css:-styling-the-web}
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation of HTML elements.
### Core Concepts {#core-concepts}
- **Selectors**: CSS selectors target specific HTML elements to apply styles to. Common selectors include:
- **Element selectors**: Select elements based on their tag name (e.g., `p`).
- **Class selectors**: Select elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., `.my-class`).
- **ID selectors**: Select an element with a specific ID attribute (e.g., `#my-id`). ID selectors should be unique on the page.
- **Attribute selectors**: Select elements based on their attributes (e.g., `[type="text"]`).
- **Pseudo-classes**: Select elements based on their state (e.g., `:hover`, `:active`).
- **Pseudo-elements**: Style specific parts of an element (e.g., `::before`, `::after`).
- **Properties**: CSS properties define the styles to be applied (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `background-color`).
- **Values**: Values specify the value of a CSS property (e.g., `red`, `16px`, `#ffffff`).
- **Declaration**: A CSS declaration consists of a property and a value (e.g., `color: red;`).
- **Rule Set**: A CSS rule set consists of a selector and one or more declarations, enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).
```css
p {
color: blue;
font-size: 14px;
}.highlight {
background-color: yellow;
}
```
### Ways to Include CSS {#ways-to-include-css}
- **Inline Styles**: Applied directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute. Avoid using this for anything beyond very specific overrides as it mixes content (HTML) with presentation (CSS) and is hard to maintain.
```html
<p style="color: green;">This is a paragraph with inline styles.</p>
```
- **Internal Styles**: Defined within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
```html
<head>
<style>
p {
color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
```
- **External Styles**: Defined in separate `.css` files and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. This is the preferred method for maintainability and reusability.
```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
### CSS Box Model {#css-box-model}
The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for HTML elements and laid out according to the visual formatting model. It consists of:
- **Content**: The actual content of the element (e.g., text, images).
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: A line that surrounds the padding and content.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
### CSS Layout {#css-layout}
CSS provides various layout techniques for arranging elements on a page:
- **Normal Flow**: The default layout behavior, where elements are displayed in the order they appear in the HTML document.
- **Float**: Positions an element to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to flow around it. Often used for simple multi-column layouts.
- **Positioning**: Allows you to precisely control the position of an element on the page.
- `static`: The default positioning. The element is positioned according to the normal flow.
- `relative`: The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
- `absolute`: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position other than static). If there is no positioned ancestor, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (the `<html>` element).
- `fixed`: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it always stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
- `sticky`: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It's treated as relative until the scroll position reaches a specified threshold, at which point it becomes fixed.
- **Flexbox**: A one-dimensional layout model that provides a more efficient way to distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
- **Grid**: A two-dimensional layout model that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. Much more powerful for building complex page layouts compared to float or even flexbox.
### Responsive Design {#responsive-design}
Responsive design is an approach to web design that aims to create web pages that look good and function well on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Key techniques include:
- **Media Queries**: Allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation.
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
/* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
body {
font-size: 14px;
}
}
```
- **Flexible Grid Layouts**: Using percentages or other relative units for widths and heights, rather than fixed pixels.
- **Flexible Images**: Ensuring images scale properly on different screen sizes. Use `max-width: 100%; height: auto;`
## JavaScript: Adding Interactivity {#javascript:-adding-interactivity}
JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language that enables you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
### Core Concepts {#core-concepts}
- **Variables**: Used to store data. Declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. `let` and `const` are preferred over `var` due to their block scoping. `const` declares a constant, whose value cannot be reassigned.
- **Data Types**: JavaScript has several built-in data types, including:
- **String**: Represents textual data.
- **Number**: Represents numeric data (integers and floating-point numbers).
- **Boolean**: Represents a logical value (true or false).
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
- **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
- **Symbol**: Represents a unique and immutable identifier.
- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
- **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values.
- **Operators**: Used to perform operations on variables and values (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`). `==` and `!=` check for equality with type coercion, while `===` and `!==` check for strict equality without type coercion. It's almost always better to use `===` and `!==` to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Control Flow**: Statements that control the order in which code is executed.
- **if...else**: Executes different code blocks based on a condition.
- **switch**: Selects one of several code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.
- **for**: Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
- **while**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- **do...while**: Repeats a block of code at least once, and then continues as long as a condition is true.
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- **Objects**: Collections of properties and methods.
- **Arrays**: Ordered lists of values.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript can access and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document.
### Ways to Include JavaScript {#ways-to-include-javascript}
- **Inline Scripts**: Directly within HTML elements using event handler attributes (e.g., `onclick`). Avoid this approach for anything but extremely basic examples as it mixes content (HTML) and behavior (JavaScript).
```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!');">Click Me</button>
```
- **Internal Scripts**: Defined within the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of the HTML document.
```html
<head>
<script>
function myFunction() {
alert("Hello!");
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click Me</button>
</body>
```
- **External Scripts**: Defined in separate `.js` files and linked to the HTML document using the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` or `<body>` section. This is the preferred method for maintainability and reusability. Placing `<script>` tags at the end of the `<body>` allows the HTML to load first, improving perceived performance.
```html
<head>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```
### DOM Manipulation Examples {#dom-manipulation-examples}
```javascript
// Get an element by its ID
const myElement = document.getElementById("my-element");
// Change the text content of an element
myElement.textContent = "New Text";
// Change the style of an element
myElement.style.color = "red";
// Add a class to an element
myElement.classList.add("highlight");
// Remove a class from an element
myElement.classList.remove("highlight");
// Create a new element
const newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
// Append the new element to the body
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
//Add Event Listener
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
alert('Button clicked!');
});
```
### Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) {#asynchronous-javascript-and-xml-(ajax)}
AJAX allows you to update parts of a web page without reloading the entire page. This is commonly done using the XMLHttpRequest object or the fetch API.
```javascript
// Using the Fetch API
fetch('https://api.example.com/data').then(response => response.json()).then(data => {
console.log(data); // Process the data
}).catch(error => {
console.error('Error:', error);
});
```
### JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries {#javascript-frameworks-and-libraries}
Several JavaScript frameworks and libraries can simplify web development, including:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Angular**: A comprehensive framework for building client-side applications.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- **jQuery**: A library that simplifies DOM manipulation, AJAX, and animation. (Less commonly used now with improvements to native JavaScript)
## PHP: Server-Side Scripting {#php:-server-side-scripting}
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. It's embedded within HTML and executed on the server before the page is sent to the user's browser.
### Core Concepts {#core-concepts}
- **Syntax**: PHP code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags.
- **Variables**: Used to store data. Variables in PHP start with a dollar sign (`$`).
- **Data Types**: PHP supports various data types, including:
- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- **Operators**: Similar to JavaScript, PHP uses operators for performing operations on variables and values.
- **Control Flow**: PHP provides control flow statements like `if...else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `foreach`.
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- **Arrays**: Ordered lists of values. PHP supports both numerically indexed and associative arrays (key-value pairs).
- **Superglobals**: Predefined variables that are always accessible, regardless of scope. Examples include:
- `$_GET`: Contains variables passed through the URL (e.g., `?name=John`).
- `$_POST`: Contains variables passed through an HTTP POST request (e.g., from a form).
- `$_REQUEST`: Contains variables from both `$_GET` and `$_POST`.
- `$_SESSION`: Contains session variables (data stored on the server to persist information between requests).
- `$_COOKIE`: Contains cookie variables (data stored on the user's browser).
- `$_SERVER`: Contains information about the server environment and the request.
### Basic PHP Syntax {#basic-php-syntax}
```php
<?php
// This is a comment
// Declare a variable
$name = "John Doe";
// Output the variable
echo "Hello, ". $name. "!"; // Output: Hello, John Doe!
// Conditional statement
if ($name == "John Doe") {
echo "<p>You are John Doe.</p>";
} else {
echo "<p>You are not John Doe.</p>";
}?>
```
### Interacting with Databases (MySQL) {#interacting-with-databases-(mysql)}
PHP is commonly used to interact with databases, such as MySQL. Here's a basic example using the mysqli extension:
```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "mydatabase";
// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
die("Connection failed: ". $conn->connect_error);
}
$sql = "SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM users";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
// Output data of each row
while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
echo "id: ". $row["id"]. " - Name: ". $row["firstname"]. " ". $row["lastname"]. "<br>";
}
} else {
echo "0 results";
}
$conn->close();?>
```
### Forms and Data Processing {#forms-and-data-processing}
```html
<form action="process.php" method="post">
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
**process.php:**
```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
$name = $_POST["name"];
$email = $_POST["email"];
echo "Name: ". htmlspecialchars($name). "<br>"; //Use htmlspecialchars to prevent XSS
echo "Email: ". htmlspecialchars($email). "<br>";
// You would typically save the data to a database here
}?>
```
It is very important to use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` and prepared statements (when interacting with databases) to prevent security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
### PHP Frameworks {#php-frameworks}
Several PHP frameworks can simplify web development, including:
- **Laravel**: A popular framework known for its elegant syntax and rich features.
- **Symfony**: A flexible and powerful framework for building complex applications.
- **CodeIgniter**: A lightweight framework that is easy to learn.
## Hosting: Deploying Your Web Application {#hosting:-deploying-your-web-application}
Hosting involves making your web application accessible on the internet.
### XAMPP: Local Development Environment {#xampp:-local-development-environment}
XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. It provides a local environment for developing and testing web applications before deploying them to a live server.
- **Installation**: Download and install XAMPP from the Apache Friends website.
- **Starting XAMPP**: Start the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP control panel.
- **Document Root**: Place your web application files in the `htdocs` directory (usually located in the XAMPP installation directory).
- **Accessing Your Application**: Access your application in a web browser by navigating to `http://localhost/your-application`.
- **Database Management**: Use phpMyAdmin (accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`) to manage your MySQL databases.
### AWS: Cloud Hosting {#aws:-cloud-hosting}
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of cloud computing services, including hosting solutions for web applications.
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides virtual servers in the cloud. You can launch an EC2 instance with your preferred operating system and web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx). You have full control over the server.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Provides object storage for storing static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript). Can be configured to serve static websites directly.
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Provides an easy-to-use platform for deploying and managing web applications. Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and application health monitoring. It supports various languages and platforms, including PHP, Node.js, Python, and Java.
- **Lightsail**: Provides virtual private servers (VPS) that are easy to set up and manage. It's a good option for simple web applications.
- **Route 53**: A scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. Used to manage your domain name and point it to your web application.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Provides managed relational database services (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Lambda**: A serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Useful for event-driven applications and backend tasks.
### Deploying a PHP Application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk {#deploying-a-php-application-to-aws-elastic-beanstalk}
1. **Create an AWS Account**: Sign up for an AWS account if you don't already have one.
2. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application**:
- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
- Click "Create Application".
- Enter an application name and description.
3. **Create an Environment**:
- Choose a platform (e.g., PHP).
- Choose an environment type (e.g., Web server environment).
- Configure environment settings, such as instance type, security groups, and database settings. You can also customize the PHP version.
4. **Upload Your Application Code**:
- Package your PHP application code into a ZIP file.
- In the Elastic Beanstalk console, upload the ZIP file to your environment.
5. **Configure Your Application**:
- Set environment variables (e.g., database credentials).
- Configure your application to use the correct database settings.
6. **Deploy Your Application**: Elastic Beanstalk will automatically deploy your application to the specified environment.
7. **Monitor Your Application**: Use the Elastic Beanstalk console to monitor the health and performance of your application.
### Domain Name Configuration {#domain-name-configuration}
- **Register a Domain Name**: Register a domain name with a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, AWS Route 53).
- **Configure DNS Records**:
- Create an A record that points your domain name to the public IP address of your EC2 instance or Elastic Load Balancer.
- Create a CNAME record that points your www subdomain to your domain name.
- **Update Nameservers**: Update the nameservers for your domain name to point to the nameservers provided by your DNS provider (e.g., AWS Route 53).
### Web Server Configuration (Apache on EC2) {#web-server-configuration-(apache-on-ec2)}
If using an EC2 instance directly (without Elastic Beanstalk), you need to configure the web server manually:
1. **Install Apache**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```
2. **Configure Virtual Hosts**: Create a virtual host configuration file for your domain.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/your-domain.conf
```
Example:
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName your-domain.com
ServerAlias www.your-domain.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/your-domain
<Directory /var/www/your-domain>
AllowOverride All
Require all granted
</Directory>
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
3. **Enable the Virtual Host**:
```bash
sudo a2ensite your-domain.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
4. **Place Your Application Files**: Place your application files in the DocumentRoot directory (e.g., `/var/www/your-domain`).
## Core Web Development Concepts {#core-web-development-concepts}
### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) {#http-(hypertext-transfer-protocol)}
HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is a request-response protocol between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server.
**Request Methods:**
- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
- **POST**: Sends data to the server to create or update a resource.
- **PUT**: Replaces an existing resource with the provided data.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a resource.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
**Status Codes:** Three-digit codes that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request.
- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server refuses to authorize the request.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected error.
### RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) {#restful-apis-(representational-state-transfer)}
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.
- **Resources**: Represented by URLs.
- **Stateless**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.
- **Cacheable**: Responses should be cacheable to improve performance.
- **Uniform Interface**: APIs should have a consistent and predictable interface.
### Web Security {#web-security}
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: An attack where malicious scripts are injected into websites. Prevent XSS by sanitizing user input and encoding output. Use `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP.
- **SQL Injection**: An attack where malicious SQL code is injected into database queries. Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements and parameterized queries.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: An attack where a malicious website tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on another website where they are authenticated. Prevent CSRF by using anti-CSRF tokens.
- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between the client and the server. Obtain an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt) and configure your web server to use HTTPS.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and resources. Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.
### Version Control (Git) {#version-control-(git)}
Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.
### Remote Server Management Tools {#remote-server-management-tools}
PuTTY and FileZilla are tools commonly used when working with web servers, particularly when you're managing your own server (like an EC2 instance on AWS). They are most relevant in the "Hosting: Deploying Your Web Application" section, specifically when configuring and managing a web server directly.
#### PuTTY (SSH Client) {#putty-(ssh-client)}
PuTTY is an SSH (Secure Shell) client. It's used to connect to a remote server over a secure, encrypted connection. You would use PuTTY to access the command line of your EC2 instance (or any remote Linux server). This allows you to:
- Install software (like Apache, MySQL, PHP).
- Configure the web server.
- Troubleshoot issues.
- Manage files.
**Where it fits in the guide**: PuTTY is essential for the "Web Server Configuration (Apache on EC2)" section. After launching an EC2 instance, you'd use PuTTY to connect to it and perform the steps outlined (installing Apache, configuring virtual hosts, etc.).
#### FileZilla (FTP Client) {#filezilla-(ftp-client)}
FileZilla is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client. It's used to transfer files between your local computer and a remote server. While not as secure as SSH, FileZilla provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to simply upload and download files. You would use FileZilla to:
- Upload your website's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) to the server.
- Download files from the server for editing or backup.
**Where it fits in the guide**: FileZilla is useful in the "Web Server Configuration (Apache on EC2)" and "Deploying a PHP Application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk" sections. You can use it to upload your application files to the correct directory on your EC2 instance or to transfer files to the environment that Elastic Beanstalk creates.
#### Setup Instructions {#setup-instructions}
**Connecting to Your Server with PuTTY**
1. **Download and Install PuTTY**: Download PuTTY from its official website and install it on your computer.
2. **Get Your EC2 Instance's Public IP**: In the AWS Management Console, find your EC2 instance and note its public IP address or public DNS.
3. **Start a PuTTY Session**:
- Open PuTTY.
- Enter the public IP address (or DNS) of your EC2 instance in the "Host Name" field.
- Ensure the "Connection type" is set to "SSH".
- Click "Open".
4. **Log In**:
- When prompted, enter the username for your EC2 instance. The default username for Amazon Linux is `ec2-user`. For Ubuntu it's often `ubuntu`.
- If you are using key-based authentication (recommended), PuTTY will use the private key file you configured. Otherwise, you may be prompted for a password.
**Transferring Files with FileZilla**
1. **Download and Install FileZilla**: Download the FileZilla Client from its official website and install it on your computer.
2. **Get Your Server Credentials**: You'll need the following information:
- **Host**: The public IP address (or DNS) of your EC2 instance.
- **Username**: The username for your server account.
- **Password**: The password for your server account (if using password authentication). It's strongly recommended to use key-based authentication instead.
- **Port**: The SSH port (usually 22).
3. **Connect to Your Server**:
- Open FileZilla.
- Enter the host, username, password, and port in the Quickconnect bar at the top.
- Click "Quickconnect".
4. **Transfer Files**:
- The left side of FileZilla shows your local files. The right side shows the files on your server.
- Drag and drop files between the two sides to upload and download them.
#### Git Core Concepts {#git-core-concepts}
- **Repositories**: A Git repository contains all the files and history of a project.
- **Commits**: A snapshot of the changes made to the code at a specific point in time.
- **Branches**: A separate line of development that allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merging**: Combining the changes from one branch into another.
- **GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket**: Online platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code.
### Package Managers (npm, Composer) {#package-managers-(npm,-composer)}
Package managers automate the process of installing, updating, and managing dependencies (libraries, frameworks) for your project.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: For JavaScript projects. Uses a `package.json` file to track dependencies.
- **Composer**: For PHP projects. Uses a `composer.json` file to track dependencies.
### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) {#content-delivery-networks-(cdns)}
CDNs are networks of servers that distribute content to users based on their geographic location. Using a CDN can improve the performance and availability of your web application by caching static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) and serving them from the server closest to the user.

### Web Performance Optimization {#web-performance-optimization}
- **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Reduce the number of files that need to be downloaded by combining CSS and JavaScript files, using CSS sprites, and inlining small images.
- **Compress Files**: Use Gzip or Brotli compression to reduce the size of files transmitted over the network.
- **Cache Static Assets**: Configure your web server to cache static assets in the browser and on the CDN.
- **Optimize Images**: Use optimized image formats (e.g., WebP) and compress images to reduce their file size.
- **Minify CSS and JavaScript**: Remove unnecessary characters (e.g., whitespace, comments) from CSS and JavaScript files to reduce their size.
- **Defer Loading of Non-Critical Resources**: Load non-critical CSS and JavaScript files asynchronously or defer their loading until after the page has loaded.
- **Use a CDN**: Distribute static assets using a CDN to improve performance for users around the world.
